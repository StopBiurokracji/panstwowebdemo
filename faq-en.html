        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
        <p><strong>What is this campaign about?</strong><br>
        It's a civic initiative to create a unified digital system for public administration in Poland. Fewer logins, fewer forms, less frustration.</p>
        <p><strong>Is the petition official?</strong><br>
        Yes â€” once enough signatures are collected, it will be submitted to relevant institutions with full justification.</p>
        <p><strong>How can I become a volunteer?</strong><br>
        Just go to the "Volunteers" section and send your contact details.</p>
        <p><strong>Are my data safe?</strong><br>
        This test site doesn't store data on a server. Once the production version is online, we will follow GDPR standards and use encryption.</p>
        <p><strong>How can I help without signing?</strong><br>
        Share the campaign, talk to others, or support us with skills like design, programming, or outreach.</p>
